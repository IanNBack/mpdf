# mpdf
mPDF is a standalone PHP library to generate PDF files from UTF-8 encoded HTML and CSS.
I stopped developing mPDF in 2015 at Version 6.0, and this GitHub site is not under active development.

There is a comprehensive manual available in both PDF (made using mPDF) and EPUB formats.

The example/demo PDFs were published to demonstrate new developments in earlier versions; they serve as a  
good showcase for what mPDF can do, and supplement the manual with example code etc.

mpdf60.zip contains the main library - it contains a README file, and there are installation
instructions in the manual. It also contains a folder of /examples/

There are 2 additional .zip files containing extra fonts for different languages. The contained TTF files
should be copied into the /ttfonts/ folder in your mPDF installation.

Others have chosen to continue development of mPDF - and they do so with my blessing.
One of these is at https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf
